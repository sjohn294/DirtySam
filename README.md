# UNCC-Bootcamp-Project-1

# Steps

## First: We came up with a name for the website based on our concept of what we wanted to do which was designing an application that allowed the end user to pick a region in North Carolina and receive the top rated trails within that region. They were also able to receive the weather at the same time based on where the trail was located.

## Second: We took some time to narrow dowm a few APIs and do some research to determine which ones would suite our purpose.

## Third: We start on designing the main html which was the home page. We incorporated an image as the background and with a little research figured out how to keep it from repeating and fill the whole page.

## Fourth: We also designed the name bar with an anchor tag, which was our home button, and our drop down which was how the end user could select their targeted region.

## Fifth: Three of us branched off designing each of the regions html page and styling it with css while the fourth member researched how to fetch the API.

## Sixth: Two of us starting working on the functionality of the Javascript through multiple functions and the other two took the time to finalized some of the stylizing and responsiveness.

## Seventh: Hard deployement, checking for any additional bugs, and correcting any last minute issues.
